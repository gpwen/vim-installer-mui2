This branch (misc) contains some files to support the NSIS installer, but not
necessarily part of the installer.  It's used as a catchall place for
miscellaneous files to avoid cluttering of the main development branch.

lang-tmpl : Language file template for various languages.
logo      : Vim logo & miscellaneous artworks in SVG format.  All derived from
            the scalable logo in Vim repository (runtime/vimlogo.pdf).
