    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p1.png!
    <br><br>

    This dialog will be shown only if multiple language support has been
    enabled.  It determines the language used in the following pages.

    User selected language (as Windows(TM) LCID) will be written to
    Windows(TM) registry:
    <pre><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Vim\Installer Language</code></pre>
    Global variable $LANGUAGE will also be set to that LCID.

    <br><br>

    This serves as the old installation confirmation dialog.  Once user press
    "next", the installer will check for running Vim instance, and try to
    uninstall any existing Vim.

    A black DOS window will flash by even if no Vim has installed.

h3. Page 2 : License Agreement

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p3.png!
    <br><br>

    This page should be checked a little bit carefully.  This is the pristine
    license page of NSIS, which makes it pretty clear what's been shown is a
    license agreement and user must agree to it.  Please let me know if you
    think that's not appropriate.

h3. Page 3 : Components

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p4.png!
    <br><br>

    Detailed description of components will be shown here.

h3. Page 4 : Destination Path

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p5.png!

     The installer will check for running Vim instance again when user press
     "install".

h3. Page 5 : Installation

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p6.png!
    <br><br>

    There is a noticeable pause near the end when "install.exe" being executed
    silently (2s delay in install.exe).

h3. Page 6 : Finish

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p7.png!
    <br><br>

    User can determine whether README.txt should be shown or not on this page.

h1. Uninstaller Pages

Uninstaller has 4 pages.

h3. Page 1: Confirmation.

    <br><br>

    Combination of components will be checked to make sure it's valid.  Vim
    installation root is not allowed to be removed if user choose to keep some
    components under it.

    Uninstaller will check for running instances of Vim once user press
    "Uninstall".

h3. Page 3: Uninstallation

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u3.png!
    <br><br>

    Noticeable pause when "Unregistering Vim ...", as "uninstall.exe" is been
    executed silently there.

h3. Page 4: Finish

    !http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u4.png!
    <br><br>

    If some components cannot be removed without reboot, the reboot selections
    will be shown on this page.  Otherwise, those selections won't be shown.
    This is a nice feature of NSIS.
