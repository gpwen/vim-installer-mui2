h1. Installer Pages

Installer has 7 to 8 pages.

h3. Language selection dialog

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p1.png!

This dialog will be shown _only if_ multiple language support has been enabled.  It determines the language used in the following pages.

User selected language (as Windows LCID) will be written to the Windows registry:
@HKLM\SOFTWARE\Vim\Installer Language@

Global variable @$LANGUAGE@ will also be set to that LCID.

h3. Page 1 : Welcome page

This serves as the old installation confirmation dialog.

h3. Page 2 : License Agreement

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p3.png!

This is the pristine license page of NSIS, which makes it pretty clear what's been shown is a license agreement and user must agree to it.

h3. Page 3 : Components

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p4.png!

This page let user choose components to install.  Detailed description of each component will be shown here.

The installer will find all version(s) of Vim that has been installed on the system, and create a dynamic uninstall component for each version found.  User can choose to keep some versions, in which case uninstaller of those versions will not be launched at all.  However, user cannot keep the same version as the one been installed for obvious reason.

Currently the installer supports 5 old versions at most.  The number can be increased, but _who needs more than 5 different versions of Vim installed in parallel?_(TM)

Once installation starts, the installer will launch uninstaller for those selected old versions one by one, wait until they complete.  All these will be done "natively" with NSIS script, no external executable will be used, so no "black window" will be shown as compared to the official installer.

h3. Page 4 : Destination Path

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p5.png!

Let user choose destination path to install Vim.

Once user pressed "install", the following check will be performed:
* No running Vim instance should exist;
* The destination path must end with "vim" (case-insensitive).

The installer won't continue until all above conditions have been satisfied.

h3. Page 5 : Installation

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p6.png!

There is a noticeable pause near the end when "install.exe" being executed silently in background (2s delay in install.exe).

h3. Page 6 : Finish

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/install/p7.png!

User can determine whether README.txt should be shown or not on this page.

h1. Uninstaller Pages

Uninstaller has 4 pages.

h3. Page 1: Confirmation.

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u1.png!

h3. Page 2: Components

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u2.png!

User can choose whether or not to remove @vimfiles@ and Vim installation root directories.  Those are common directories shared by all Vim versions installed under the same root directory.  They won't be removed by default.  The component description will warn user above consequences of removing those directories.

Combination of components will be checked to make sure it's valid.  Vim installation root is not allowed to be removed if user choose to keep some components under it.

Uninstaller will check for running instances of Vim once user press "Uninstall".

h3. Page 3: Uninstallation

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u3.png!

Noticeable pause when "Unregistering Vim ...", as "uninstall.exe" is been executed silently there.

h3. Page 4: Finish

!http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/raw/wiki-files/screenshots/uninstall/u4.png!

If some components cannot be removed without reboot, the reboot selections will be shown on this page.  Otherwise, those selections won't be shown.  This is a nice feature of NSIS.
