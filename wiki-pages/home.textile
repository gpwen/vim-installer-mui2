This repository contains "NSIS":http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page scripts to build "Vim self-installing executables":http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc for MS-Windows (_a.k.a._, Windows installer).  The installer is upgraded to use "NSIS Modern User Interface 2.0":http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Modern%20UI%202/Readme.html, which provides a user interface for NSIS installers with a modern wizard style, similar to the wizards of recent Windows versions.  You can check the above link for detailed description and screenshots.
