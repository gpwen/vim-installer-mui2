h1. Introduction

This repository contains "NSIS":http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page scripts to build "Vim self-installing executables":http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc for MS-Windows (_a.k.a._, Windows installer).  The installer is upgraded to use "NSIS Modern User Interface 2.0":http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Modern%20UI%202/Readme.html, which provides a user interface for NSIS installers with a modern wizard style, similar to the wizards of recent Windows versions.  You can check the above link for detailed description and screenshots.

Please note code in this repository is a subset of Vim code base, it won't build by itself.  This repository is primarily aimed for those who build their own Vim NSIS installer.

Screenshots of the installer can be found "here":http://wiki.github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2/screenshots.

h1. Build Instruction

To build the new installer, you should *overwrite* the content of the @nsis/@ directory of the official Vim codebase with code on the "@master@":http://github.com/gpwen/vim-installer-mui2 branch, and then build the NSIS installer as normal.
